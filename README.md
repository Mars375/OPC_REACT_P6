# FishEye

FishEye is an online platform dedicated to showcasing photographers and their works. It provides a user-friendly experience for photography enthusiasts, allowing them to discover photographer portraits, sort works by date, popularity, or title, and even contact artists. This project was developed as part of a training program focused on coding best practices, object-oriented programming (OOP), and accessibility.
